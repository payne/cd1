# Class cat to wc challenge
1. Take this Cat.java and make a new file/class: Wc.java
2. Should act like wc.  See example below:

## Running Cat.java
1. javac Cat.java
2. java Cat Cat.java README.md

## Example of UNIX's wc command (your `java wc *` should behave similarly.)
The command `wc *.java *.md` outputs:
```
 22  62 506 Cat.java
 12  59 341 README.md
 34 121 847 total
```

# Background

Remember: 
```
       wc - print newline, word, and byte counts for each file
```
and it prints a total of these three columns at the bottom.
